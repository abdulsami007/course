                     <h2>Facts About Dogs</h2>
                     <p>
                        Dogs are loyal and intelligent animals that have been companions to humans for thousands of years. They belong to the Canidae family and are descendants of wolves, but selective breeding has led to hundreds of different breeds with unique traits. Dogs have an exceptional sense of smell, which is up to 100,000 times better than humans, making them valuable for search-and-rescue missions and detecting diseases like cancer. They can also understand human emotions and commands, with some breeds learning up to 250 words. Additionally, a dog's nose print is as unique as a human fingerprint, and no two are alike.

                            Dogs have an incredible sense of smell, which is estimated to be anywhere from 10,000 to 100,000 times more sensitive than that of humans. This powerful nose allows them to detect certain diseases, such as cancer and diabetes, just by sniffing a person. Additionally, dogs have a unique ability to understand human emotions, often responding to their owner's mood with affection and comfort. Some breeds, like Border Collies and Poodles, are exceptionally intelligent and can learn hundreds of words and commands. With their loyalty, intelligence, and companionship, dogs have been cherished pets and working partners for thousands of years.
